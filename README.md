Here's blueprints that I've worked on out of necessity


**Detached mode blueprints for Moe's Zigbee light switches that are flashed with custom firmware**


*WITH LIGHT OPTIONS (brightness, transition, rgbww colours etc)*

**If you have Moe's Zigbee light switches and want custom firmware to enable detached mode and other functionality (which gave rise to the need for these blueprints) - it is available [HERE](https://github.com/romasku/tuya-zigbee-switch)**
